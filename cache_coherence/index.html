            <span class="highlighter">Parallel processing</span> introduced a
            computer organization system that allows multiple CPUs for
            simultaneous and concurrent execution of instructions to increase
            the computing speed and throughput of the system.
          </p>

          <p>
            An <u>MIMD</u> computer organization allows for the use of multiple
            CPUs, IOPs, and ALUs in a single computer to process and execute
            instructions concurrently.
          </p>

          <p>
            All the processors have a shared connection to the same main memory.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a multiprocessor system, all the processors have a local/private
            memory cache connected to a common bus that facilitates read and
            write operations to the shared main memory. The main reason for
            having an adjunct private cache associated with each processor is to
            reduce the average access time to increase the closeness to the CPU.
          </p>

          <p>
            The same information/instructions may reside in a number of copies
            in all the private caches that are accessing the shared memory.
          </p>

          <p>
            To ensure that the system executes the correct memory operations and
            keeps all the copies of instructions across the caches identical, we
            need to look at the cache coherence problem.
          </p>

          <h3 class="sub-headers">Problem</h3>
          <p>
            A cache coherence makes sure that multiple processors are accessing
            accurate instructions/data to avoid a stale data existence.
            Modifying data in one private cache leads to inconsistencies of the
            same data present in other private cache blocks – this leads to
            cache incoherence.
          </p>

          <p>
            To illustrate the problem, let’s consider a three processor
            configuration that has 3 private caches’ along with a shared main
            memory (shown in Fig 1.1).
          </p>

          <p>
            At some point in time, let’s assume that an element (X) is loaded
            into the P1, P2, and P3 processors. For simplicity let X contain the
            value 70. When it is initially loaded, all the processors and the
            shared memory will have a consistent copy of X (shown in Fig 1.1).
            Whenever a processor wants to modify the data in its private cache
            with a write request, inconsistent data will be said to exist in the
            remaining caches and main memory.
          </p>

          <p>
            We can depict this with the
            <em>write-through and write-back strategies of the cache.</em>

            Suppose a store of X is issued by P1 and updates the value of X in
            its cache to 130, a new value in the write-through protocol. As a
            result, the value of X in both the cache and the shared memory would
            be updated.
          </p>

          <p>
            Write through maintains consistency of data between the private
            cache and main memory while the other two caches (P2 and P3) contain
            invalid/stale data (shown in Fig 1.2). In the case of a write-back
            protocol, the new value of X is only rendered in the private cache
            of P1 with the new value 130 – it is tagged by a dirty or modified
            bit. In write-back the store doesn’t modify the main memory, which
            leads to inconsistencies across the remaining two caches of P2, P3,
            and the main memory (shown in Fig 1.3).
          </p>

          <p>
            Data inconsistencies that lead to cache incoherence may also occur
            in DMA (Direct memory access) transfers between IOP (e.g., disks)
            and the main memory. Thus, the following deals with ways in which to
            overcome cache incoherence and increase its execution efficiency.

            <li>
              Disallow the use of private cache memories for each processor in a
              multiprocessor system and have a shared cache memory associated
              with the main memory instead. However, this increases the average
              access times, which makes the system slower.
            </li>
            <li>
              Another technique is to only allow non-shared and read-only data
              to be stored in the cache – these items are said to be cacheable.
              Shared writable data is said to be non-cacheable. The
              non-cacheable data remains in the shared main memory while
              read-only data is allowed to be accessed into the cache. However,
              this creates a software overhead and reduces performance.

          <h2 class="blog-headers">Write-through protocol</h2>
          <p>
            In a cache that uses a write-through protocol, there are two schemes
            or versions to overcome cache incoherence.
          </p>
          <ol style="margin: 2rem">
            <li>
              <h3 class="sub-headers">Updating</h3>
            </li>
            <p>
              When a processor writes a new value into its block of cache, it is
              also written into the main memory to maintain consistency between
              them. Since copies of this data are also present in the cache
              blocks of other processors that contain older data, a simple way
              to update all the cache blocks is by issuing a broadcast signal to
              write the updated data into the cache blocks. As a result, all the
              copies of the cache will be said to contain updated/new data.
            </p>

            <li>
              <h3 class="sub-headers">Invalidation</h3>
            </li>
            <p>
              Once the modified data is written into the processor’s private
              cache and sent to the main memory, the copies of stale data
              present in the other cache blocks will be invalidated with an
              invalidation broadcast that disallows the processor to access said
              data.
            </p>
          </ol>
          <h2 class="blog-headers">Write back protocol</h2>
          <p>
            The block-to-be-updated ownership of the block-to-be-updated is made
            exclusive only to the processor that requested a write operation on
            it and issued an invalidate broadcast request. If another processor
            wishes to read the modified block, the request is sent to the
            current owner and a read is serviced to the processor while it
            updates the main memory.
          </p>

          <p>
            Suppose another processor requests a write operation on a memory
            block that has been modified. In that case, the processor’s cache
            block containing it sends the data to the requesting processor along
            with its ownership while the current processor invalidates its copy.
          </p>

          <p>
            These are the methods used by a write-back cache protocol to avoid
            cache incoherence.
          </p>
          <h2 class="blog-headers">Cache controller</h2>
          <p>
            A cache controller is designed to monitor all requests placed on the
            common bus connecting the shared main memory and the cache blocks.
            The bus controller that monitors this action is called the
            <strong class="highlighter">cache controller</strong> as it snoops
            the bus network for possible write operations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Based on the request, the controller either invalidates its caches’
            data or updates it when a match is detected in its cache block.
            Every cache block associated with a processor has a snoopy
            controller that monitors the bus network, such a cache is called a
            <strong class="highlighter">snoopy cache.</strong>
