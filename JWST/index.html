            If you’re a science freak then make no mistake in not reading this
            article about the
            <span class="highlighter">“JAMES WEBB TELESCOPE”</span> because
            believe me it’s a beautiful piece of astro-technical equipment
            that’s gonna tantalize you.
          </p>

          <p>
            The JWST or the “WEBB” is a space telescope that is planned to be
            the successor of the “Hubble Space Telescope”. The HST was launched
            on April 24 1990 and has done its part in space exploration as one
            of the most versatile and powerful telescope to be ever created by
            human kind. It paved way for solving the mysteries of the universe
            such as data on exo-planets, pinning down the age of the universe,
            discovery of galaxies in the early age of formation of universe and
            many more. Sadly, everything has an expiry date and the HST has
            proven its might. Its time for the JWST to do its work.
          </p>

          <p>
            The JWST is set to launch in March 2021 despite delays and other
            technical issues. It has an advantage over the Hubble as it provide
            a higher infrared resolution and sensitivity which enables a wide
            range of investigation across the field of astronomy and cosmology
            including formation of stars and planets, imaging of exo-planets and
            nova.
          </p>

          <p>
            The primary mirror of the JWST, the Optical Telescope Element, is
            composed of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of gold-plated
            beryllium which combine to create a 6.5-meter (21 ft; 260 in)
            diameter mirror that is much larger than the Hubble's 2.4-meter (7.9
            ft; 94 in) mirror. Unlike the Hubble, which observes in the near
            ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared (0.1 to 1 μm) spectra, the
            JWST will observe in a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength
            visible light through mid-infrared (0.6 to 28.3 μm), which will
            allow it to observe high redshift objects that are too old and too
            distant for the Hubble to observe.[10][11] The telescope must be
            kept very cold in order to observe in the infrared without
            interference, so it will be deployed in space near the Earth–Sun L2
            Lagrangian point, and a large sunshield made of silicon- and
            aluminium-coated Kapton will keep its mirror and instruments below
            50 K (−220 °C; −370 °F). It has a NIRCam, NIRSpec, MIRI, FGS/NIRISS
            guiders, sensors and spectrometers on it to provide most authentic
            observation and stability.

          <p>
            The JWST is being developed by NASA—with significant contributions
            from the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency[1]—and
            is named for James E. Webb, who was the administrator of NASA from
            1961 to 1968 and played an integral role in the Apollo program.

          <p>
            This one-of-a-kind telescope which takes space exploration to the
            next dimension to reveal its mysteries beyond reality is set to
            launch soon. So, stay tuned.
